# Form_Builder-React_Redux

Form builder is a dynamic form builder using React, Typescript, MUI, and localStorage.

Users should be able to:
1. Create dynamic forms with customizable fields and validations
2. Preview how a form behaves for the end user
3. View a list of saved forms
4. Persist all form configurations in localStorage (No backend required)

Here is route and their description :

Route /create	->  Build a new form by dynamically adding and configuring fields

Route /preview -> Interact with the currently built form like an end user

Route /myforms -> View all previously saved forms from localStorage
